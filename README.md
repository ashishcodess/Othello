# Othello

Othello is a board game where two players play in a table of size 8x8 .The players can be two humans playing the game , one human playing
against AI or human simulating a game between two AI with different difficulties.In either cases one player plays with black tokens and
the other with white tokens.

There are many other functionalities like choosing the rules , saving the current state and loading the game from the saved state and many 
more so if you want to dig more into functionality of entire project and want to know how the game works,you can check the
