# Othello

Othello is a board game where two players play in a table of size 8x8 .The players can be two humans playing the game , one human playing
against AI or human simulating a game between two AIs with different difficulties.In either cases one player plays with black tokens and
the other with white tokens.

There are many other functionalities like choosing the rules , saving the current state and loading the game from the saved state and many 
more so if you want to dig more into functionality of entire project and want to know how the game works,you can check the 
Manual Usuario.pdf inside DOCS folder.But my apologies if you do not understand Spanish.

## Run the game

To run the interface of the game go to ```src > othello > java ``` and then execute main.

## Issues

We developed this game using IntelliJ IDEA Community version .Some time while cloning the directory and running it in your computer you may 
see that intellij doesnot detect the executable class ,if that is the case go to ```File > Project Structure > Modules ``` then delete the current
Content Root and add the content rotue again and you are good to go.
